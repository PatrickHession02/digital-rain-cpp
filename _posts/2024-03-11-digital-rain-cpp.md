## Introduction
In the following blog I will explain the process that went into making my C++ digital Rain Project. The project brief was to develop a modern C++ console application to execute my own interpretation of Digital Rain

## Design and Test
#Vectors
Vectors in modern C++ are dynamic arrays that can grow and shrink in size as needed. They are part of the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) and are defined in the <vector> header file. Vectors are designed to store elements of the same data type and provide a range of functionalities for manipulating these elements, such as adding, accessing, modifying, and removing elements.

Key Features of Vectors:
Dynamic Size: Unlike arrays, vectors can change their size during the execution of a program. This makes them suitable for situations where the number of elements is not known in advance.
Contiguous Memory: Vectors store their elements in contiguous memory locations, which allows for efficient iteration and access to elements.
Automatic Memory Management: Vectors handle memory allocation and deallocation automatically, which simplifies memory management.
Ease of Use: Vectors offer a wide range of member functions for common operations, such as adding elements to the end (push_back()), accessing elements (at(), operator[]), and iterating over elements.
Basic Operations with Vectors:
Declaration and Initialization: Vectors can be declared and initialized in various ways, including using the default constructor, initializer list, or by copying from another vector.
Adding Elements: The push_back() function is used to add elements to the end of a vector.
Accessing Elements: Elements can be accessed using the at() function or the operator[]. The front() and back() functions provide access to the first and last elements of the vector.
Modifying Elements: Elements can be modified using the operator[] or the at() function.
Removing Elements: The erase() function can be used to remove elements from a vector.
Iterating Over Elements: Vectors can be iterated over using iterators or range-based for loops.
